sentence=A custom library for generating PWM values using PID.
paragraph=To use the library call the constructor, then initialise kp, ki, kd, max and min output values, 
sample time, and low pass filter time constant using the begin() function. 
Then call the move() function with the desired setpoint and the current position which will 
return a float value which can be used to set the PWM value of a motor.
The library handles clamping the output values, and the low pass filter is used to smooth the output.
